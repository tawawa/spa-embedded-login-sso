# OIDC Single Sign-on Sample

## Prerequisites

1. Go to https://manage.auth0.com/#/clients and create a single-page
   application client with OIDC Conformant mode enabled
2. Add `http://app1.com:3000` and `http://app1.com:3000/callback.html` as
   allowed callback URLs
3. Enter your Auth0 domain and client ID in the
   [`auth0-variables.js`](/auth0-variables.js) file.

## Running the sample

To start the sample, start a web server in the root of this repository at port
3000, or just run:

``` make ```

Tend to use:

```
http-server -p 3000
```

Using Chrome Web Browser, I use dev tools to ensure `disable cache` is on.


Browse to [http://app1.com:3000](http://app1.com:3000).

## How this sample works

We are checking two things in local storage to detect if a user is logged in or
not:

* `accessToken`: the Auth0 access token to access our desired API, which in
* this case is `/userinfo` `expirationDate`: the expiration date of this token,
* calculated using the `expires_in` response parameter after a successful
* authentication

If there is no valid access token present in local storage, the user is not
logged in to our application, but they might have logged in via SSO to another
application.  We can detect if this is the case by calling the `checkSession`
method of auth0.js, which will attempt to silently authenticate the user inside
an iframe.

Silent authentication works in the same way as regular authentication (i.e.
redirects the user to `/authorize`), but with some differences:

* A `prompt=none` parameter is added to the redirect to `/authorize`.
This causes Auth0 to return an error in case the user is not logged in via SSO
instead of displaying a login page (in this case embedded).
* The redirect happens inside an iframe to preserve our application's state.
* The callback URL of this request is set to [`callback.html`](/callback.html),
* which is a dedicated page to handle the silent authentication callback.
This avoids loading your entire application again inside an iframe.

Two things can happen after a silent authentication request:

* The user did not have an active SSO session, so Auth0 calls back with an
* error (`error=login_required`) The user did have an active SSO session, so
* Auth0 calls back with an access token (`access_token=...&expires_in=...`)

In any case, the response from Auth0 is sent from the iframe back to the main
page by using `postMessage`, which allows the main page to take action based on
the outcome.  In this sample we are immediately redirecting the user to the
embedded login page if silent authentication
failed, or storing the token and its expiration date in local storage if it
succeeded. Note, the embedded login uses the cross origin flow 
(co/authenticate) on submission. The tokens are sent back to the
redirectUri supplied as hash fragments on the callback URL.
